# Alchemy SDK MultiChain Demo

This is a simple demo of how to use the Alchemy SDK with multiple chains in a single application
while managing the different API keys and endpoints for each chain.

To get started, clone this repo. Then, run `npm install` to install the dependencies. To run the
demo, run `npm run demo`.

The `src/alchemy-multi-chain-client.ts` file contains the `AlchemyMultiChainClient` class, which
is a wrapper around the Alchemy SDK that allows you to use multiple chains in a single application.
The `src/index.ts` file contains a simple demo of how to use the `AlchemyMultiChainClient` class.
